## Description:
Hi guys. In this respository, I use Scrapy to crawl from www.etsy.com.
Please feel free to clone and experiment on it. 

## How - to install:
### For novices like me:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create your working environment.
3. Inside your working environment, please create your own virtual environment because ***dependencies might messes up with your local environment***: 

`python -m venv scrapy_venv`

* in windows: 

`scrapy_venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

* in linux/unix: 

`source scrapy_venv\bin\activate`

3. Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. For running:

`python app.py`

5. Et voila

### For pros:
Welp,
